Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs

Once upon a time, a princess named Snow White lived in a castle with her father,
the King, and her stepmother, the Queen. Her father had always said to his daughter
that she must be fair to everyone at court.  Said he, “People come here to the castle
when they have a problem. They need the ruler to make a fair decision.
Nothing is more important than to be fair.”
