Thumbelina

THERE was once a woman who wished very much to have a little child, but she could not obtain her wish.
At last she went to a fairy, and said, “I should so very much like to have a little child;
can you tell me where I can find one?”
“Oh, that can be easily managed,” said the fairy.
“Here is a barleycorn of a different kind to those which grow in the farmer’s fields,
and which the chickens eat; put it into a flower-pot, and see what will happen.”
