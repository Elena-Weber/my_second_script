Beauty and the Beast

Once upon a time there was a very rich man who lived with his three daughters.
The two older daughters laughed at anyone who did not dress as well as they did.
If they were not going to a ball, they were shopping for as many fine dresses
and hats as they could carry home.
The youngest daughter, Beauty, liked to read most of all.
“No one will want you!” her two older sisters said, and they laughed.
“Look at your hair - you look like a servant girl!”  Beauty did not know
why they talked to her in a mean way. But she said nothing.
